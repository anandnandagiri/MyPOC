Fixed WSL2 Issues to use docker integrated with debian Window Store APP and apt update not works due to IP issues

Prerequisite
	1. WSL 2 on Windows 10
	2. Docker Desktop
	3. Debian Windows Store Apps


Challenges Faced

	1. Integrating Docker into Debian
	2. By default debian package are beeing compressed because of space or enabled compress (https://utf9k.net/blog/wsl2-vhd-issue/)
	3. After integration Docker Command PULL is working fine but apt update is not working
	4. In Window 10 Ethernet WSL is getting dynamic IP
	5. Debian is not getting Ethernet Up once restart
	6. Understanding /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/wsl.conf
	7. Learning IP Linux Command Since ifconfig is not available in debian windows store app (After fix install thru net-tools)
	8. Understanding Assigned IP Address, Subnetmask needs to convert to CIDR (which play major role in fixing issue)


Commands used during Troubleshooting....

	Debian Packages Path --> %LOCALAPPDATA%/packages/
	apt-get install net-tools   /* This will install Ifconfig which is missing in Debian Windows App*/


	wsl --shutdown

	ip route add default via 172.18.35.33
	ip route add default via 192.168.147.129 dev eth0
	ip route add 192.168.147.129 dev eth0


	nano /etc/resolv.conf
	nameserver 8.8.8.8

	nano /etc/wsl.conf
	[network]
	generateResolvConf = false


	Enable Ethernet and DCHP Client assign IP
		ip link set dev eth0 up
		dhclient -v eth0


	ip addr add 172.25.176.46/20 dev eth0
	default via 172.25.176.1 dev eth0


Anand Remote VM which is working fine.... To Troubleshoot compared with not working machince 

	cat /etc/resolv.conf
	nameserver 172.25.176.1

	ip a
	inet 172.25.176.46/20 brd 172.25.191.255 scope global eth0

	ip r
	default via 172.25.176.1 dev eth0
	172.25.176.0/20 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.25.176.46



-------------------------Below Resolved Issue-------------------------

Instruction:
	1. You need to know IP address to assign
	2. You need know the subnetmask to execute below commands


172.17.173.161

ip link set dev eth0 up
ip addr add 172.17.173.163/28 dev eth0
ip r add default via 172.17.173.161 dev eth0
